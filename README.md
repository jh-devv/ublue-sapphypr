A custom experimental [fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) [silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/)/[kinote](https://kinoite.fedoraproject.org/) [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) [image](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man5/containers-dockerfile.5.html), based on [ublue-os](https://github.com/ublue-os/) with the [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) wayland compositor

This is a constantly updating template repository for creating [a native container image](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable) designed to be for my needs!
